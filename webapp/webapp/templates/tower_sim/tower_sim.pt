                    This tower simulator was developed using the Unity game engine and C# scripts.  The 3D world was
                    created with assets obtained from the Unity asset store i.e. trees, grass shaders, water shaders.
                    Aircraft are models from the asset store, controlled with custom C# scripts.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Aircraft movement matches a typical class D airport with departures from full-length and the
                    intersections.  Fighter aircraft will proceed to initial and break for a right base to the
                    runway.  Other aircraft will arrive via the downwind for a left base to the runway.  After
                    aircraft land they will exit via the high speed and be deleted from the scenario.
