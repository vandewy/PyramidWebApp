                    This website was developed with the Pyramid framework, utilizing Bootstrap4 as the
                    css interface and sqlite as the database.  The contact page uses sqlite to save
                    the message to a database before using a Python library to send an email with
                    the message to my inbox.  I chose to save messages to a sqlite database as a
                    backup in case there is an issue with the Python library or connection issues;
                    the message will still be viewable.
