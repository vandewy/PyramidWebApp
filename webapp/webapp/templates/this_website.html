    <h2>Building of this website</h2>

        <p>
            This website was developed with the Django framework, utilizing Bootstrap4 as the
            css interface and sqlite as the database.  The contact page uses sqlite to save
            the message to a database before using a Python library to send an email with
            the message to my inbox.  I chose to save messages to a sqlite database as a
            backup in case there is an issue with the Python library or connection issues;
            the message will still be viewable.
